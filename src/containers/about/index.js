							<b>In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful,</b>
						</p>
						<p>
						My name is Shakeel Ahmad, and my father’s name is Abdul Kabeer.  
						My father was a Hafiz-e-Qur’an (the one who commits the entire Qur’an to his memory), 
						and that was the reason people called him Hafizji. 
							</p>
							<p>
							My ancestral place is Azamgarh in U.P. in India. 
							But I was born in the city of Banaras which now changed with Varanasi. 
							My mother told me that my date of birth is 24th December 1950.
								</p>
								<p>
									There was no Maktab (religious school) in my locality.  
									My mother used to teach the boys and girls of our locality at our house. 
									I learnt to read Qur’an from my mother. 
									After joining the Tablighi movement, I felt that I did not read Qur’an correctly. 
									I used to read it against ‘tajweed’. 
									Therefore, later I learnt to read it from a Hafiz-e-Qur’an. 
									Even now I cannot claim that I can read Qur’an perfectly, but if somebody reads it incorrectly, I can point out the mistakes. 
									After having learnt to read the Qur’an, I could also pick up a little of Urdu language. 
									Very soon I learnt reading Urdu, thanks to my extensive reading habit.
									But even now I sometimes falter in reading it owing to the fact that I did not learn it in a proper way. 
									That is the reason I ask the scholars attending my discourses to sitting close to me so that if I commit any mistake in reading they can correct me. 
									And if I say anything wrong they can rectify me. 
								</p>

								<p>
									After the completion of my High school in 1967, I came down to Bombay for sight-seeing. 
									At that time I did not know that this city will become my destiny. 
									From that time onwards I have been permanently staying in Bombay, 
									though I keep visiting my village every now and then.
								</p>
								<p>
									By the Grace of Allah, and the efforts and disciplined upbringing of my parents I have been regular in praying right from my childhood. 
									My father was a virtuous person with a very mild disposition. 
									He used to explain everything with love and affection. 
									My mother sent me to mosque for prayers from a very young age.
								</p>
								<p>
									My mother cared a lot about my upbringing. 
									She had requested one of our neighbours - Yaqub chacha - to keep an eye on me, and if I did any mischief or wrong-doing, he could himself chastise me rather than bringing the matter to my mother's notice. 
									My father used to explain to me with love and affection if I committed any mistake, but my mother would sometimes thrash me for my wrongdoings. 
									May Allah shower mercy on both my parents…(Aameen).
								</p>
								<p>
									After coming over to Bombay, I continued praying regularly. 
									In the mosque, they used to read ‘Fazail e Aamaal’. 
									It left a mark on my heart. 
									Slowly the Tablighi people started drawing close to me. 
									They tried to persuade me to join their movement, but I didn’t understand what they were trying to say, and where they wanted me to take. 
									Despite my repeated refusals, they did not stop persuading me, nor was there any change in their behaviour. 
									Eventually, with the help and guidance from Allah, I reached ‘Chuna Bhatti Tablighi Centre’. 
									The discourses over there influenced me a lot.
								</p>
								<p>
									Later, I learnt that Tablighi people stay overnight in the Centre.
									I too started staying overnight with them. 
									I got up in the night on hearing crying and wailing in the mosque to find out what was happening. 
									I learnt that these people were worried about Deen, and were crying for the sake of ummah. 
									I did not know what to worry about Deen and the Ummah was. 
									But their wailings influenced me so much that I started going to the Markaz not for sleeping but for wailing.
								</p>
								<p>
								After that, I started devoting time for the sake of Tablighi work regularly by the Grace of Allah. 
								May Allah reward those people who were the cause for my joining this Tablighi work (Aameen). 
								I started understanding what this Dawat o Tabligh work was all about. 
								I could understand now that this work is a great means of inculcating the thirst to learn about Deen among the Ummah who by and large are indifferent to learning about it.
								</p>
								<p>
									After a few days of my joining the work of Dawat o Tabligh, somebody informed me that there is a person from my village called Maulana Abdul Haleem who is a regular visitor to the Markaz.
									He runs a big madrasa. 
									And he is the ‘Khalifa’ (spiritual successor) to Hazrat Shah Wasiullah Sahib (RH). 
									But since I was new to this work, I did not know him earlier. 
									But destiny would have it that I reached there too.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I reached there the character and disposition of Hazrat influenced me so much that I started visiting him frequently. 
									Hazrat’s love and affection brought me very close to him.  
									And I got very attached to him.  
									Many a time it so happened that when somebody invited Hazrat, he would say ‘my friend Shakeel will also accompany me.’ 
									I was nobody compared to him but it was his love and such affectionate treatment that brought me closer to him.  
								</p>
								<p>
									I continued engaging myself in the Dawah work, and also kept visiting Hazrat.
									In due course, I picked up a few nuances of public speaking and felt eager to speak more and more. 
									People liked my speeches very much and spoke high of me. 
									I too felt pleased when people praised me. 
									I had the feeling that I have started speaking very well. 
									But in the good company of Hazrat, I learnt that whoever thinks highly of himself is looked down upon by the Almighty. 
									I did not realize that I was inflicted by this ailment and other ailments of the heart (spiritual).
									I knew that Hazrat had the cure for such ailments. 
									In fact, the very purpose of the ‘Khanqas’ was to impart cure to such manifest and latent ailments.
								</p>
								<p>
									I found the mention of such ailments of the heart in Hazrat’s speeches which earlier I did not know what they were.
									But now I knew that I am afflicted by such ailments. 
									There were a few acts of worship which I used to practice thinking that they were the correct Deen, and I was happy doing them and thought I was a Deendar person (religious person). 
								</p>
								<p>
									If I had not had the good company of Hazrat, I wouldn’t have known these ailments and would have been happy doing what I thought was right and would have passed away from this world with those ailments.
								</p>
								<p>
								I discussed those ailments with Hazrat, and he showed me the cure. 
								I worked on his instructions and by the Grace of Allah, those ailments started disappearing. 
								But due to my inadequate knowledge, deficiency in my deeds, and negligence, I could not recover fully from those ailments.  
								Even now I find myself bogged down by them. 
								But Hazrat’s good company gave me the knowledge of the deceptions of shaytan and our self (Nafs). 
								May Allah protect us from the deception of ‘incomplete religiousness’ and guide us to’ complete religiousness’; protect us from the deceptions of shaytan and our Nafs and help us do with sincerity what pleases Him; protect us from the manifest and latent ailments and let our end come with perfect Emaan (Aameen).
								</p>
								<p>
									I had very good relations with Hazrat Mufti Muhammad Haneef sahib during the lifetime of Hazrat (RH) itself. 
									This relates to the time when I was staying at Guraini, where Hazrat Maulana Abdul Haleem sahib Jaunpuri ran a big madrasa. 
									Hazrat Maulana Mufti Muhammad Haneef sahib was the ‘Shaikh ul-Hadeeth’ and head-mufti in that madrasa.
									I used to frequent that place.
									Since I wanted to learn ‘Deen’ (religion), I used to ask questions about different issues concerning religion to Mufti Sahib. 
									Mufti Sahib used to be very happy because of my asking these questions. 
									He must have realized that I had the quest to learn complete Deen.  His affection increased towards me. 
									In short, I kept learning the apparent Deen (Zaahiri) from Mufti Muhammad Haneef sahib, and the intrinsic Deen (Baatini) from Maulana Hazrat Abdul Haleem sahib.
								</p>
								<p>
									After the death of Maulana Abdul Haleem sahib, I approached Hazrat Mufti sahib, because Hazrat Mufti sahib was also one of the spiritual successors of Shah Wasiullah sahib, who in turn, was the successor of Hakim-ul-Ummat Hazrat Thanwi (RH).
								</p>
								<p>
									I requested Hazrat Mufti sahib for ‘baiyat’ (to take me as his disciple), but he did not do it. 
									Instead, he told me that I could ask him questions if I had any doubts. 
									He, in fact, permitted me to take ‘baiyat’ from others. 
									When he gave me the permission to take ‘baiyat’ from others I got so emotional that I fell on Hazrat’s feet and started crying and told Hazrat that I  will not be able to do justice to this great responsibility because I am not capable of doing it, so he should not give me the permission. 
									Hazrat said ‘will you tell me whether or not you are capable of it, or I should tell. 
									If somebody thinks that he is capable of doing this, it will not be given to him at all.  
									Go and do the work.’
									Later on, Hazrat accepted my ‘baiyat’ (took me as his disciple).
								</p>
								<p>
									I came down to Bombay but did not tell anybody about this development. 
									I wanted to keep it a secret.  But destiny had a different plan. 
									Despite my efforts to hide it from others, it did not remain a secret. 
									My friend, Shahabuddin, who was very close to Hazrat revealed this secret on others. 
									May Allah help me doing justice to the responsibility I have been entrusted with (Aameen).
								</p>
								<p>
									People started asking me to give ‘baiyat’, but I felt shy to do it. 
									So I refrained from doing it. 
									People used to tell Hazrat that I was not giving ‘baiyat’, and Hazrat used to chastise me and ask why I was not giving ‘baiyat’. 
									Sometimes I used to keep quiet, and sometimes I used to tell him that I didn’t find myself capable of doing it. 
									Many a time Hazrat chastised me and told me to start giving ‘baiyat’ in his lifetime itself so that if I found any difficulty I could ask him. 
									One of the devotees of Hazrat who had been pestering me for ‘baiyat’ complained to Hazrat that I was not giving ‘baiyat’ to him. 
									Hazrat again chastised me. 
									My denials and Hazrat’s chastisements continued.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I was preparing to go for the Hajj pilgrimage, and the day of my departure came by, Hazrat instructed that devotee of his to go and stay in my house, and to stay put there till I gave him ‘baiyat’. 
									This way the first ‘baiyat’ came by at about 2 o clock in the night, and despite my not wanting it, this thing took off.
								</p>
								<p>
									The disciples who had been given ‘baiyat’ by me started discussing their problems with me and I started guiding them with whatever I could do with Divine help. 
									After a few days, I told Hazrat: ‘ Hazrat! Among my disciples, none is inferior to me and I am not superior to anybody. 
									Therefore please permit me to stop giving ‘baiyat’ to them.’ 
									Hazrat said:’ till the time you think this way, keep giving ‘baiyat’. 
									And the day you start feeling that you are good and the other people are bad, stop giving ‘baiyat’.
								</p>
								<p>
									The work of Dawah and Tabligh has become my second nature. 
									Whatever I gained I gained from this work. 
									What did I gain?
									The quest for Deen, the company of scholars, the patronage of saintly people, the understanding that the work of Dawat o Tabligh is our own work, and love for the persons who were working in this line.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some people ask me what do I do? Meaning, do I do Tabligh?  Am I a monastic?  Do I run a madrasa?  Do I write books?  I tell them:’ whatever was my Prophet’s (PBUH) work is my work too.
									Whatever I can do I do. 
									And I consider the persons who are working in other departments of Deen as my benefactors.
									I pray for them.
									I have the intention that if I could do everything I would do it. 
									By the Grace of Allah, I do not consider any of the departments of Tablighi work as small or big.
									It is a special bestowal of Allah on me. 
									I urge the entire world to join the Dawat o Tabligh movement and consider it as their own work.
									But they should seek guidance from scholarly and saintly persons.
									May Allah guide us all, and protect us from the deceptions of Shaytan and Nafs, and also protect us from going astray by getting overawed by our emotions (Aameen).
								</p>
								<p>
									After joining the Tablighi movement, I started getting interested in reading books.
									When I went to the market to buy Deeni books in Urdu, I was pained to see that the paper used for printing these religious books was of very low quality, whereas paper used for filmy books and otherworldly books was of a good standard. 
									I felt very ashamed, and it pained me a lot. 
									I started thinking as to what could be done in this regard. 
									My continued thinking made me a publisher. 
									The idea behind starting of ‘Hira publication” was this worry.
									Regarding ‘Hira publication”, it is necessary for one to know that:  ‘ Hira publication’ is not the property of any one person.
									It is an endowment in the way of Allah.
									It has the patronage of scholars and muftis.
									The purpose of this establishment is:
								</p>
								<p>
									1. To prepare small booklets out of the voluminous works of righteous scholars, so that the common man finds it easy and affordable to buy and read them.
								</p>
								<p>
									2. To publish books in different languages according to the needs of the people, so that people are made aware of the religion and it becomes easy for them to acquire religious knowledge.
								</p>
								<p>
									The books published by Hira are of a very high standard, using good quality paper and attractive titles so that the inner and outer beauty of the books is maintained.
								</p>
								<p>
									By the Grace of Allah, people have appreciated and liked the books published by Hira publications. 
									Though the books are priced a little on the higher side owing to good quality being maintained, they are being patronized by the connoisseurs. 
									And people pray for us.
								</p>
								<p>
									As far as my website is concerned, I was not aware of it, and I did not know what had been written in it about me.
									When I started receiving phone calls from people stating that they have been benefitted by my discourses, I asked them where they listened to them. 
									They say it was on my website. 
									I tell them I didn’t know that there was a website in my name. 
									Then I learnt that a few of my friends have created a website in my name, to upload my books and discourses.
									It also contained my introduction. 
									When I saw my introduction, I felt it was unnecessary and incomplete. 
									I thought it appropriate to give my introduction in my own words. 
									Therefore I have dictated these few lines.
								</p>
								<p>
									The website contains my books. 
									But the standard of the paper used and the printing etc will be known only on seeing the hard copy-the books themselves. 
									The books from Hira publications are of high quality-good paper and beautiful printing - and therefore appeal to one and all.
									Please pray that Allah extracts work of Deen from me till my last breath, and protect us and all His creatures from tribulations and trials, and accept us for the work of all the departments of Deen, and be always happy and pleased with us all. Aameen.
